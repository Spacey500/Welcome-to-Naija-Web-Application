# Welcome to Naija Web Application
This is a remake of my web application that was built in the Deakin College class, SIT120-Introduction to Responsive Web Apps. Welcome to Naija is a tourist guide app for people who are interested in visiting Nigeria but have no idea where to start. This app will provide information on the Nigeriaâ€™s famous landmarks and fun activities to do in each city. Also, the app will contain recipes on Nigerian and accommodation options available. Overall, this app will showcase Nigerian cultures to upcoming tourists. In SIT120, I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and the Javascript framework, Vue, to create this application.
